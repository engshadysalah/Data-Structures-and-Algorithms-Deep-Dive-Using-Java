     for algortihm : 
     2 types of complixty 
     1: time complexity :  number of steps that takes to execute the algorithm .
     2: memory complexity : amount of memory that takes to run the algorithm . {not issus becose memory become cheeps this days}
    
     so : we intersted with : 1:time complexity
    
     1:time complexity : 
     we have 
     1: best case = best time complexity.
     2: worset case = worset time complexity.
     but we compare the worest case between algorithms.

     Big-O-Notaion :
    
     O(1)       :  Constant
     O(logn)    :  Logarithmic
     O(n)       :  Linear
     O(nlogn)   :  n log-star n
     O(n^2)     :  Quadratic

     mark : base of log is 2
     member : look to graph of Big-O-Notaion in vedio 011
