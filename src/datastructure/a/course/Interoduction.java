         1: Data structure vs Algorithms
        
        Data structure : 
         - Organization and Stores data.
         - each has strengs and weeknesses  
        
        
        
         Algorithms: 
         - set of instructions or set of steps to do spsecific process
         - has iputs and then you need to get specific output like [ cake ]
        
        
         2: same task can be accomplish by many algorithms
         3: same algorithm can be implemented by many differient ways
